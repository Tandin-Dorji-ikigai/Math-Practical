    Create a dataframe using the information provided in the table above. [2]

    Compute the harmonic mean, variance and mode for the columns labeled 'Age' and 'Salary'. [3]

    Create a bar chart to illustrate the salary data of the staff, and label the axis with the proper column names. [2]

Question 4

You have three bags that each contain 100 marbles:

    Bag 1 has 75 red and 25 blue marbles;
    Bag 2 has 60 red and 40 blue marbles;
    Bag 3 has 45 red and 55 blue marbles.

You choose one of the bags at random and then pick a marble from the chosen bag, also at random. What is the probability that the chosen marble is blue? [4]

# P_A be choosing one of the bag at random
#P_AB be picking a marble from choose bag
#P_B be chosen marble is blue
#For bag 1
P_A = 1/3
P_B = 25/100
#P_AB = P_AnB/P_B
P_AB = (1/3*25/100)/(25/100)
print("Bag1: ",P_AB)

 # For bag2
P_A1 = 1/3
P_B1 = 40/100
#P_AB = P_AnB/P_B
P_AB1 = ((1/3)*(40/100))/(40/100)
print("Bag2: ", P_AB1)

 # For bag3
P_A2 = 1/3
P_B2 = 55/100
#P_AB = P_AnB/P_B
P_AB2 = (1/3*55/100)/(55/100)
print("Bag3: ", P_AB2)

print ("The probability that the chosen marble is blue: ", P_AB*P_AB1*P_AB2)

Bag1:  0.33333333333333326
Bag2:  0.3333333333333333
Bag3:  0.33333333333333326
The probability that the chosen marble is blue:  0.037037037037037014

Question 5

A coin is either fair or biased, with a 75% chance of being biased. The biased coin comes up heads with a probability of 0.6, while the fair coin comes up heads with a probability of 0.5. If we toss the coin and it comes up heads, what is the probability that it is the biased coin? [4]

P_A = ((0.25*0.5)/0.6) + ((0.75*0.5)/0.5)
P_A
print("The probability that it is the biased coin: ", P_A)

The probability that it is the biased coin:  0.9583333333333334

Question 6

Assume there are six multiple choice questions in a brief quiz. Each question contains four possible responses, any of which is correct. On every question, a student makes a guess.

    Find the probability that student gets exactly 4 questions right. [3]

    Find the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the distribution. [3]

from scipy.stats import binom
#Question1
# p = 1/4 = 0.25 probability of getting correct answer

p = binom.pmf(n = 6, k = 4, p = 0.25)

print("The probability that student gets exactly 4 questions right: ", p , 'or ', 3.3, "%")

The probability that student gets exactly 4 questions right:  0.03295898437499997 or  3.3 %

#Question2
print( "The mean of the distribution: ", binom.mean(n = 6, p = 0.25))
print()
print("The variance of the distribution: ", binom.var(n = 6, p = 0.25))
print()
print("The standard deviation of the distribution: ", binom.std(n = 6, p = 0.25))

The mean of the distribution:  1.5

The variance of the distribution:  1.125

The standard deviation of the distribution:  1.0606601717798212

f(x)={29(5‚àíx),0,2‚â§x‚â§5otherwise

Find the E(X2),Var(X), and standard deviation of X. [1.5 + 2 + 0.5]

import sympy as smp

x = smp.Symbol('x')

fx = (2/9)*(5-x)

fx2 = (x**2)*(2/9)*(5-x)
EX2 = smp.integrate(fx2,(x,2,5))
print("ùê∏(ùëã2): ", EX2 )
print()

#Variance
var = EX2 - (EX)**2

print("Variance of X: ", var)
print()

#standard deviation
sd = (var)**(0.5)
print("Standard deviation of X: ", sd)

ùê∏(ùëã2):  9.50000000000000

Variance of X:  0.500000000000002

Example 9: Two unbiased dice are thrown once and the total score is observed. Use a simulation to find the estimated probability that the total score is even or greater than 7?

Solution: Following are the steps to be followed;

    Run the experiment 1000 times (roll 2 dice 1000 times, and sum the result)
    Keep track of the number of times that the sum was either greater than 7 or even
    Divide the number from step 2 by the number of iterations (1000)

Awesome! Now let's code this and see what the probability is!


import numpy as np
import random


#Function for roll the Dice

def roll_the_dice(n_simulations = 1000):
  count = 0

  #Each iteration of the for loop is trial
  for i in range(n_simulations):

    #Roll each Die
    die1 = random.randint(1,7)
    die2 = random.randint(1,7)

    #Sum the values to get the score
    score = die1 + die2

    #decide if we should add it to the count
    if score % 2 == 0 or score > 7:
      count += 1
  return count/n_simulations

string = 'The probability of rolling an even number or greater than 7 is:'

Example 10: A box contains 10 white balls, 20 reds and 30 greens. Draw 5 balls with replacement. what is the probability that:
